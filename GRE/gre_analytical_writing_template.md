Examples are built around the prompt: **"Is social media more harmful than beneficial for society?"**

This example will argue that it is **more harmful**.

***

### **1. Introduction**

**a. Hook** – Open with a general truth, provocative question, or brief real-world context related to the prompt.
> *Example:* "For millennia, human connection was defined by physical proximity and tangible community. Today, it is defined by algorithms and screens."

**b. Bridge** – Acknowledge nuance or the opposing viewpoint (briefly).
> *Example:* "While social media platforms promise a world of unprecedented connectivity and have given voice to marginalized groups, this utopian vision masks a darker, more troubling reality."

**c. Thesis** – Clearly state your stance (agree/disagree/mixed) and list two strong, defendable reasons you’ll actually expand on.
> *Example:* "I believe social media is fundamentally more harmful than beneficial because its core design degrades individual mental health through constant social comparison and erodes public trust by accelerating the spread of misinformation."

### **2. Body Paragraph I: First Reason (Individual Mental Health)**

**a. Topic Sentence** – Introduce your first reason.
> *Example:* "First and foremost, the curated reality presented on social media platforms creates an environment where anxiety and feelings of inadequacy flourish."

**b. Example** – Use a real, specific example (or a plausible hypothetical, clearly marked).
> *Example:* "Consider a teenager scrolling through Instagram. They are inundated with images of peers on exotic vacations, celebrities with seemingly perfect bodies, and influencers showcasing unattainable lifestyles. This endless stream of highlights, stripped of the mundane or difficult aspects of life, presents a distorted view of reality."

**c. Analysis** – Connect the example directly to your thesis: How does this prove your point?
> *Example:* "This constant exposure inevitably leads the teenager to compare their own normal life to these curated fantasies, fostering a sense of dissatisfaction and low self-worth. The platform's algorithm then feeds them more of this content, creating a vicious cycle. This proves that the very architecture of social media is engineered in a way that is detrimental to the mental health of its users."

### **3. Body Paragraph II: Second Reason (Societal Misinformation)**

**a. Topic Sentence** – Introduce your second reason.
> *Example:* "A similar pattern of corrosion emerges on a societal scale, as these same platforms have become powerful engines for the spread of dangerous misinformation."

**b. Example** – Different domain if possible (for range), but still relevant and clear.
> *Example:* "During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, scientifically baseless claims about fake cures or conspiracy theories regarding vaccines spread virally across Facebook and Twitter. Emotionally charged, sensationalist posts were shared millions of times, often reaching a wider audience more quickly than official guidance from public health institutions like the World Health Organization."

**c. Analysis** – Explain why this strengthens your thesis.
> *Example:* "This example demonstrates how social media's prioritization of engagement over accuracy has dire consequences. By amplifying the most inflammatory content, these platforms actively undermined public trust in science and government, leading to real-world harm. This strengthens the thesis that social media is more harmful than beneficial by showing its capacity to destabilize society itself."

### **4. Concession + Rebuttal (Optional, but recommended if time allows)**

**a. Acknowledge a counterargument** – Briefly present the opposing view.
> *Example:* "Critics of this view might argue that social media is a vital tool for activism, pointing to movements like #BlackLivesMatter or the Arab Spring as proof of its power to organize and enact positive change."

**b. Rebuttal** – Explain why it’s limited, misguided, or less important than your reasons.
> *Example:* "While this potential for good is real, it is a byproduct of the technology, not its primary function. The same algorithmic tools that can unite a protest can also be used to spread hate and organize violence with greater efficiency. The fundamental design, which rewards outrage over nuance, ultimately makes the platform a far more reliable tool for division than for constructive progress."

### **5. Conclusion (Optional if short on time)**

-**a. Restate your thesis** using fresh wording.
> *Example:* "In conclusion, despite its initial promise of a more connected world, social media has ultimately proven to be a destructive force for both the individual psyche and the collective social fabric."

**b. Summarize key reasons** briefly.
> *Example:* "By fostering toxic comparison that damages mental well-being and creating an ecosystem where falsehoods travel faster than truth, its negative impacts are undeniable."

**c. End with a closing insight**—a forward-looking or philosophical thought.
> *Example:* "Until we fundamentally re-evaluate a business model that profits from outrage and anxiety, the question we must ask is not whether we can fix social media, but whether we can afford its price."
