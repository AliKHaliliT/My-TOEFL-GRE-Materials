### General Tips
•	Do not look at the clock!
•	Stay calm and don't panic.
•	Always mention "based on the passage or lecture" in your writing.
•	Should you take notes? No. But if you must, consider using spider web note-taking.

### Writing Tips
•	Remember to capitalize the first letter of names (like countries and people) and "I."
•	Pay attention to your spelling :)

### Speaking Tips
•	Provide examples!
•	Speak slowly.
•	Stay calm and don't panic.
•	Try to avoid rewinding and repeating your sentences too much when you correct yourself.
•	If I remember correctly, the reading section comes first, followed by listening, and then speaking. The trick is to finish the first two sections quickly so you can start speaking before others. This helps you concentrate because once everyone else starts the speaking section, it can get noisy. I managed to save enough time on the first two sections that I finished speaking before others began, which allowed me to finish the entire exam 20 minutes early.

### Reading Tips
•	Always read the entire paragraph, even if you think you've found the answer.
•	The last question is usually a summary question.
•	Try checking the questions before reading the passage. Sometimes, the questions are just simple vocabulary questions. If you have a strong enough vocabulary, you can skip reading the passage for those and save time.
•	Try to understand what the passage is about.
•	Think about how the author might try to deceive you.
•	Answer the questions as you read.
