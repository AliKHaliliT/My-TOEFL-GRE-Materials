### **Template 1: The Integrated Writing Task**

This task requires you to summarize and compare a reading passage with a lecture on the same topic. The lecturer almost always disagrees with or casts doubt on the points made in the reading. The key is to show you understand the relationship between the two sources.

#### **The Template**

**1. Introduction**
* **Sentence 1 (The Topic):** Introduce the topic and state the main point of the reading passage.
    > *Phrase:* "The passage discusses/explains/provides reasons for [the main topic of the reading]..."
* **Sentence 2 (The Conflict):** State that the lecturer disagrees with or challenges the passage's claims.
    > *Phrase:* "...However, the lecturer casts doubt on these claims / disagrees with the passage / argues that this view is not entirely accurate."
* **Sentence 3 (Roadmap):** Briefly state that the lecturer provides specific counterarguments.
    > *Phrase:* "He/She explains his/her reasons as follows:"

**2. Body Paragraph I: First Point vs. Counterpoint**
* **Sentence 1 (Passage's Point):** State the first reason or claim from the reading passage.
    > *Phrase:* "Firstly, the passage claims/states/suggests that..."
* **Sentence 2 (Lecturer's Counterpoint):** Explain the lecturer's rebuttal to this specific point.
    > *Phrase:* "The lecturer refutes this by explaining/pointing out/arguing that..."
* **Sentence 3 (Lecturer's Elaboration - Optional):** Add a specific detail or example the lecturer used to support their counterpoint.
    > *Phrase:* "He/She emphasizes this by mentioning..."

**3. Body Paragraph II: Second Point vs. Counterpoint**
* **Sentence 1 (Passage's Point):** State the second reason or claim from the reading passage.
    > *Phrase:* "Secondly, the reading posits/argues that..."
* **Sentence 2 (Lecturer's Counterpoint):** Explain the lecturer's rebuttal to this second point.
    > *Phrase:* "The lecturer challenges this idea, stating that..."
* **Sentence 3 (Lecturer's Elaboration - Optional):** Add a specific detail or example the lecturer used.
    > *Phrase:* "For example, he/she notes that..."

**4. Body Paragraph III: Third Point vs. Counterpoint**
* **Sentence 1 (Passage's Point):** State the third reason or claim from the reading passage.
    > *Phrase:* "Finally, the passage asserts that..."
* **Sentence 2 (Lecturer's Counterpoint):** Explain the lecturer's final rebuttal.
    > *Phrase:* "The lecturer disagrees, explaining that in reality..."
* **Sentence 3 (Lecturer's Elaboration - Optional):** Add a specific detail or example the lecturer used.
    > *Phrase:* "He/She provides the example of..."

**5. Conclusion**
* **Sentence 1 (Summary of Conflict):** Briefly restate that the lecturer's points challenge the validity of the passage's explanation.
    > *Phrase:* "In conclusion, the points made by the lecturer effectively challenge the arguments presented in the passage."
* **Sentence 2 (Final Thought):** Conclude that the passage's claims are weakened or that the true cause/situation is more complex.
    > *Phrase:* "Considering the lecture, the explanation in the reading seems incomplete/unconvincing/flawed."

#### **Example Scenario: The Extinction of the Dodo Bird**

* **Reading Passage Claims:** 1) Dodos were hunted to extinction by sailors for food. 2) They went extinct because newly introduced pigs ate all their eggs. 3) Their forest habitat was completely destroyed by settlers.
* **Lecture Rebuts:** 1) Dodo meat was reportedly tough and unpleasant; sailors preferred other food. 2) While pigs were a problem, dodos faced many predators, and pigs alone couldn't have wiped them out so fast. 3) Significant forest habitat remained on the island of Mauritius even after the dodo went extinct.

**Applying the Template:**

> The passage provides three common explanations for the extinction of the dodo bird. However, the lecturer casts doubt on these claims, arguing that the traditional story is not entirely accurate. She explains her reasons as follows:
>
> Firstly, the passage claims that dodos were hunted to extinction by sailors needing food. The lecturer refutes this by explaining that historical records from sailors describe dodo meat as being tough and unappetizing. She emphasizes that sailors often preferred to eat pigeons and other available wildlife.
>
> Secondly, the reading argues that invasive pigs, introduced by humans, were the primary cause of extinction because they ate dodo eggs. The lecturer challenges this idea, stating that while pigs were certainly a threat, they were one of many new predators. She notes that it's unlikely one species alone could be responsible for a total and rapid extinction.
>
> Finally, the passage asserts that the dodo's forest habitat was completely destroyed by human settlers. The lecturer disagrees, explaining that in reality, large portions of the forest on Mauritius were still intact when the dodo disappeared. Therefore, complete habitat loss could not have been the definitive cause.
>
> In conclusion, the points made by the lecturer effectively challenge the arguments presented in the passage. Considering the lecture, the traditional explanation for the dodo's extinction seems simplistic and likely flawed.

### **Template 2: Writing for an Academic Discussion**

This task requires you to read a professor's question and two student responses. You must then contribute your own opinion to the discussion, adding a new idea or perspective. The goal is to be concise, clear, and constructive.

#### **The Template**

**1. Opening Statement & Acknowledgment**
* **Sentence 1 (General Truth):** Start with a broad, relevant statement about the topic.
    > *Phrase:* "The way we [topic] is a complex issue with many valid viewpoints." or "[Topic] is a crucial aspect of..."
* **Sentence 2 (State Your Position):** Clearly state your own opinion, often relating it to the other students' comments. You can agree with one, disagree with another, or offer a middle ground.
    > *Phrase:* "While I can see the merit in [Student A]'s point, I tend to agree more with [Student B]." or "Both [Student A] and [Student B] make good points, but I believe the most important factor is..."

**2. Justification & Elaboration**
* **Sentence 3 (Your Core Idea):** Introduce your unique reason or perspective that adds to the conversation.
    > *Phrase:* "In my opinion, the key element we should consider is..." or "From my perspective, the real issue stems from..."
* **Sentence 4 (Develop Your Idea):** Briefly explain or give an example to support your new point.
    > *Phrase:* "For example, if..." or "This is because..."

#### **Example Scenario: Online vs. In-Person University Classes**

* **Professor's Question:** Is it better for universities to offer classes primarily online or in-person?
* **Student A (Paul):** In-person classes are better because they allow for spontaneous discussions and networking with peers.
* **Student B (Sarah):** Online classes are better because they offer flexibility for students who work or live far from campus, making education more accessible.

**Applying the Template:**

> The debate over online versus in-person education is a crucial one for modern universities. While I understand Paul's point about the value of face-to-face interaction, I tend to agree more with Sarah's focus on accessibility.
>
> In my opinion, the most important factor is not the format itself, but how well the university supports its students within that format. For example, an online course can be just as engaging as an in-person one if the professor uses interactive tools, hosts regular virtual office hours, and creates online forums for student collaboration. The flexibility of online learning is a massive benefit, and its potential downsides can be overcome with thoughtful course design.
